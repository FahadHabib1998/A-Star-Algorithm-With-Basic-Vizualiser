# A*-algorithm-with-basic-vizualiser


A* algorithm is an shortest path finding algorithm. 

This program uses an 2D array as a map and has two coordinates selected, starting coordinate and the target coordinate. The program then uses A* algorithm to find the shortest path from the starting to the target coordinate, then displays the map and path using matplotlib
